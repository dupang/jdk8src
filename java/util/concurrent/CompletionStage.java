/**
 * A stage of a possibly asynchronous computation, that performs an
 * action or computes a value when another CompletionStage completes.
 * A stage completes upon termination of its computation, but this may
 * in turn trigger other dependent stages.  The functionality defined
 * in this interface takes only a few basic forms, which expand out to
 * a larger set of methods to capture a range of usage styles: <ul>
 *
 * 一个可能异步计算的阶段，执行一个动作或计算一个值当另一个CompletionStage完成。
 * 一个阶段完成当计算终止的时候，但是这可能相应地触发另一个依赖的stages。这个
 * 接口定义的功能只是一些基本形式，扩展到更大的方法集合捕获一系列的使用样式：
 *
 * <li>The computation performed by a stage may be expressed as a
 * Function, Consumer, or Runnable (using methods with names including
 * <em>apply</em>, <em>accept</em>, or <em>run</em>, respectively)
 * depending on whether it requires arguments and/or produces results.
 * For example, {@code stage.thenApply(x -> square(x)).thenAccept(x ->
 * System.out.print(x)).thenRun(() -> System.out.println())}. An
 * additional form (<em>compose</em>) applies functions of stages
 * themselves, rather than their results. </li>
 *
 * 被一个阶段执行的计算可能是表达为Function,Consumer,或Runnable,(使用带有apply,accept或run名字的方法)
 * 取决于他是否需要参数和产生结果。
 * 例如，stage.thenApply(x->square(x)).thenAccept(x->System.out.print(x)).thenRun(() -> System.out.println()))
 * 另外的形式compose作用于stages自己的函数，而不是他们的结果。
 *
 * <li> One stage's execution may be triggered by completion of a
 * single stage, or both of two stages, or either of two stages.
 * Dependencies on a single stage are arranged using methods with
 * prefix <em>then</em>. Those triggered by completion of
 * <em>both</em> of two stages may <em>combine</em> their results or
 * effects, using correspondingly named methods. Those triggered by
 * <em>either</em> of two stages make no guarantees about which of the
 * results or effects are used for the dependent stage's
 * computation.</li>
 *
 * 一个stage的执行可能被一个单独的stage的完成触发，或是两个stages，或两者中的一个。
 * 取决于一个单独的stage用带着前缘then的方法被安排。被两个stages触发的stage可以
 * combine他们的结果或效果，使用相应的命名方法。被两个中的其中一个触发的stage
 * 不保证那一个的结果或效果被使用。
 *
 * <li> Dependencies among stages control the triggering of
 * computations, but do not otherwise guarantee any particular
 * ordering. Additionally, execution of a new stage's computations may
 * be arranged in any of three ways: default execution, default
 * asynchronous execution (using methods with suffix <em>async</em>
 * that employ the stage's default asynchronous execution facility),
 * or custom (via a supplied {@link Executor}).  The execution
 * properties of default and async modes are specified by
 * CompletionStage implementations, not this interface. Methods with
 * explicit Executor arguments may have arbitrary execution
 * properties, and might not even support concurrent execution, but
 * are arranged for processing in a way that accommodates asynchrony.
 *
 * stages之间的依赖控制计算的触发条件，但是不保证任何的特定的顺序。另外，一个新stage的
 * 计算的执行可能被安排为三中方法方法中的任何一个：默认的执行，默认的异步执行
 * (使用带着async后缀的方法服务于stage的默认的异步执行能力)，或自定义的
 * （通过提供的Executor）。默认和异步模式执行的性能被CompletionStage的实现来指定，而不是这个接口。
 * 带着明确的Executor参数的方法可以有任意的执行性能，并且可能不支持同步执行，
 * 但是为了处理以一个容纳异步的方法被安排。
 *
 * <li> Two method forms support processing whether the triggering
 * stage completed normally or exceptionally: Method {@link
 * #whenComplete whenComplete} allows injection of an action
 * regardless of outcome, otherwise preserving the outcome in its
 * completion. Method {@link #handle handle} additionally allows the
 * stage to compute a replacement result that may enable further
 * processing by other dependent stages.  In all other cases, if a
 * stage's computation terminates abruptly with an (unchecked)
 * exception or error, then all dependent stages requiring its
 * completion complete exceptionally as well, with a {@link
 * CompletionException} holding the exception as its cause.  If a
 * stage is dependent on <em>both</em> of two stages, and both
 * complete exceptionally, then the CompletionException may correspond
 * to either one of these exceptions.  If a stage is dependent on
 * <em>either</em> of two others, and only one of them completes
 * exceptionally, no guarantees are made about whether the dependent
 * stage completes normally or exceptionally. In the case of method
 * {@code whenComplete}, when the supplied action itself encounters an
 * exception, then the stage exceptionally completes with this
 * exception if not already completed exceptionally.</li>
 *
 * 两个方法支持处理是否触发的stage正常地完成或异常地完成：方法whenComplete允许
 * 动作的注入而不管结果，否则保存结果在完成中。方法handle另外允许stage计算一个
 * 替换的结果可能使被其它的依赖的stage进一步的处理.在所有其它情况中，如果stage的
 * 计算带着异常或错误突然终止，那么所有依赖的stage需要它的完成也异常地完成。用
 * CompletionExecption保存异常作为它的cause.如果一个stage依赖两个stage,
 * 并且两个都异常地完成，然后CompletionExecption可以保存两者中的其中一个异常。
 * 如果一个stage依赖两者中的一个，并且只有其中一个完成异常，不保证是否依赖的stage
 * 正常地完成或异常地完成。在whenComplete方法情况下，当提供一动作自己遇到了异常，
 * 那么stage异常地完成带着这个异常，如果还没有异常地完成。
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All methods adhere to the above triggering, execution, and
 * exceptional completion specifications (which are not repeated in
 * individual method specifications). Additionally, while arguments
 * used to pass a completion result (that is, for parameters of type
 * {@code T}) for methods accepting them may be null, passing a null
 * value for any other parameter will result in a {@link
 * NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <p>This interface does not define methods for initially creating,
 * forcibly completing normally or exceptionally, probing completion
 * status or results, or awaiting completion of a stage.
 * Implementations of CompletionStage may provide means of achieving
 * such effects, as appropriate.  Method {@link #toCompletableFuture}
 * enables interoperability among different implementations of this
 * interface by providing a common conversion type.
 *
 * 所有方法遵循上面的触发，执行，和异常的完成规范(在单独的方法规范中不再重复)。另外，
 * 被用来作为完成结果传给方法的参数可能是null,传递一个null值给任何参数将会抛出
 * NullPointerException异常。
 *
 * 这个接口接口没有定义初始化创建，正常或者异常地强制完成，完成状态或结果，或等待stage完成的方法。
 * CompletionStatage可能适合地提供完成这个功能的方法。toCompletableFuture方法通过提供一个
 * 通用的转换类型使协同工作在这个接口的不同实现之间。
